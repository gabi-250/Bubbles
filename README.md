# Tiles
An attempt at creating an android game. Essentially, tapping a square results in score it forms an area of a particular colour with the neighbouring tiles. The 'area' of tiles is removed and replaced by the tiles on top and the rest of the 'board' is filled with random new tiles.

Discontinued because the use of buttons as tiles makes it too difficult to animate or add any new functionality.
